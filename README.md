## Architecture

### Major Components

- **CLI Interface**: Handles user input/output and command processing
- **API Client**: Communicates with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokemon data
- **Cache System**: Stores API responses to minimize network requests
- **Pokemon Storage**: Manages the user's caught Pokemon collection

### Data Flow

1. User enters a command
2. Command is processed and relevant function is called
3. If data is needed, the system first checks the cache
4. If not in cache, an API request is made and the result is cached
5. Data is displayed to the user

## Dependencies

- **Standard Go libraries**: bufio, encoding/json, fmt, io, math/rand, net/http, os, strings, time
- **Custom cache package**: `github.com/Thomaaseth/pokedex/internal/pokecache`

## API

This project utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open RESTful Pokemon API.
